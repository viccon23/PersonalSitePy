Hi, my name is Victor and I'm a Computer Science student at UTRGV. I'm passionate about Coding and learning about Technology, whether it's Frontend, Backend, or Full Stack. I am also interested in subjects Operating Systems, Databases, Networks, and much more.
I am excited to see myself learn more as I continue my university studies, and can't wait to see what lies ahead.
